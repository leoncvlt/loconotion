[site]

  # each key in the table maps to an atttribute in the tag
  # the following adds the tag <meta name="title" content="Loconotion Test Site"/>
  [[site.meta]]
  name = "title"
  content = "Loconotion Test Site"
  [[site.meta]]
  name = "description"
  content = "A static site generated from a Notion.so page using Loconotion"

  ## Custom Fonts ##
  # you can specify the name of a google font to use on the site - use the font embed name
  # if in doubt select a style on fonts.google.com and navigate to the "embed" tag to 
  # check the name under CSS rules
  # the following table keys controls the font of specific elements:
  #   site: changes the font for the whole page (apart from code blocks) 
  #         but the settings below override it
  #   navbar: site breadcrumbs on the top-left of the page
  #   title: page title (under the icon)
  #   h1: heading blocks, and inline databases' titles
  #   h2: sub-heading blocks
  #   h3: sub-sub-heading blocks
  #   body: non-heading text on the page
  #   code: text inside code blocks

  ## Custom Element Injection ##
  # defined as an array of tables [[site.inject]], followed by 'head' or 'body' to set 
  # the injection point, followed by name of the tag to inject
  # each key in the table maps to an atttribute in the tag
  # e.g. the following injects this tag in the <head>:
  #   <link href="favicon-16x16.png" rel="icon" sizes="16x16" type="image/png"/> 
  [[site.inject.head.link]]
  rel="icon" 
  sizes="16x16"
  type="image/png"
  href="/example/favicon-16x16.png"
  
  # the following injects this tag in the in the <body>:
  #   <script src="custom-script.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  # note that all href / src files are copied to the root of the site folder 
  # regardless of their original path
  [[site.inject.body.script]]
  type="text/javascript"
  src="/example/custom-script.js"

## Individual Page Settings ##
# the [pages] table defines override settings for individual pages, by defining 
# a sub-table named after the page url (or part of the url, but careful about
# not using a string that appears in multiple page urls)
[pages]
  # the following settings will only apply to this page: 
  #   https://www.notion.so/d2fa06f244e64f66880bb0491f58223d
  [pages.d2fa06f244e64f66880bb0491f58223d]
    ## custom slugs ##
    # inside page settings, you can change the url for that page with the 'slug' key
    # e.g. page "/d2fa06f244e64f66880bb0491f58223d" will now map to "/games-list"
    slug = "games-list"

    # change the description meta tag for this page only

    # change the body font for the list page only
    [pages.d2fa06f244e64f66880bb0491f58223d.fonts]
    body = 'DM Mono' 

  # set up pretty slugs and options for the other database pages
